# Real-Time Speech Translation

## Overview
The project attempts to record live audio from an **input device** of choice and translates the speech to english with [faster_whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) by SYSTRAN.

For **Mac** users, to capture internal audio, (BlackHole)[https://existential.audio/blackhole/] by Existential Audio setup is recommended. [Further info will be discussed down...](#BlackHole_Setup)

## Features
* Real-time audio capture from specified audio device.
* Real-time audio transcription/translation
* Real-time feedback of transcription/translation with Text to Speech (mac only)

## Setup/Installation and Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Efesasa0/real-time-speech-translation.git
